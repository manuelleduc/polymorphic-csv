- Smart compilation. adapt the code generation according to the operations used. For instance is the only operation done is a simple line counting, it might not be required to import a CSV library.
- Dealing with temporary/local variable. How to avoid name collisions?
- Adding the notion of test. How to test the result of a csv parsing using many implementations. How to compare the performance of an algorithm on many targeted language, etc.
